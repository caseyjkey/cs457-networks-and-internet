1) Do the client sockets block waiting for an event? (True/False)
False

2) How do asynchronous operations among clients happen? (1 or 2 sentences describing the mechanism)
Asynchrous connections are done by registering a selector when a connection is established. This can be done happen many times, and can be serviced independently.
