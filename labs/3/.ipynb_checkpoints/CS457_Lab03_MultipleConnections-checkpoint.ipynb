    "This lab introduces the `select` module so that we can have multiple clients connect to our ECHO server instead of just one.  Furthermore, the sockets will operate asynchronously so that we can interleave the operations of all clients and not have to wait for one client to finish before another can begin.\n",

    "### Introductory Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "The echo server you experimented with in lab 1 definitely had a number of limitations that we are going to deal with in this lab. The biggest limitation is that it serves only one client and then exits. The echo client has this limitation too, but there’s an additional problem. When the client makes the following call, it’s possible that s.recv() will return only one byte, b'H' from b'Hello, world':\n",
    "\n",
    "`data = s.recv(1024)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The bufsize argument of 1024 used above simply **specifies** the maximum amount of data to be received at once. It doesn’t mean that `recv()` will actually return 1024 bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`send()` also behaves this way. `send()` **returns** the number of bytes sent, which may be less than the size of the data passed in. You are responsible for checking this and calling `send()` as many times as needed to send all of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    ">“Applications are responsible for checking that all data has been sent; if only some of the data was transmitted, the application needs to attempt delivery of the remaining data.” [(Source)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.send)\n",
    "\n",
    "We avoided this issue in lab 1 by using `sendall()`:\n",
    "\n",
    ">“Unlike send(), this method continues to send data from bytes until either all data has been sent or an error occurs. None is returned on success.” [(Source)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#socket.socket.sendall)\n",
    "\n",
    "We have two problems at this point:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How do we handle multiple connections concurrently?\n",
    "* We need to call `send()` and `recv()` until all data is sent or received.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we do? There are many approaches to [concurrency](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrency.html). More recently, a popular approach is to use [Asynchronous I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html). `asyncio` was introduced into the standard library in Python 3.4. Those of you who took the CS481A3 course on blockchain saw the equivalent library when we used the `async` and `await` javascript keywords.  An alternative method for concurrency that is the more traditional choice in network programming is to use *threads*. \n",
    "\n",
    "The trouble with concurrency is it’s hard to get right. There are many subtleties to consider and guard against. All it takes is for one of these to manifest itself and your application may suddenly fail in not-so-subtle ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must also be careful of language capabilities and limitations -- Python's methods for concurrency fall into two distinct categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [**Threads**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html), which run on only one CPU core due to Python's *Global Interpreter Lock* [GIL](https://realpython.com/python-gil/).  Essentially this is a method to do \"time-slicing\" where one thread blocks so that other threads can still execute.  But this is not true parallel processing -- only one thread is actually running at any particular point in time.   \n",
    "\n",
    "*  [**Multiprocessing**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html), which uses full-scale system processes and can run on multiple cores for true parallel operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, for this tutorial, we’ll use something that’s even more traditional than threads and that is easier to reason about. We’re going to use the granddaddy of network system calls: `select()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`select()` allows you to check for I/O completion when you have multiple open sockets in use, many of which are likely to be blocked and waiting.  You can call `select()` to see which sockets have I/O ready for reading and/or writing. But this is Python, so there’s more. We’re going to use the [`selectors`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html) module in the standard library so the most efficient implementation is used, regardless of the operating system we happen to be running on:\n",
    "\n",
    ">“This module allows high-level and efficient I/O multiplexing, built upon the select module primitives. Users are encouraged to use this module instead, unless they want precise control over the OS-level primitives used.” [(Source)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though, by using `select()`, we’re not able to run on multiple cores in parallel, this approach will still be very fast. The actual speed depends on what your application needs to do when it services a request and the number of clients it needs to support. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `asyncio` capability uses single-threaded cooperative multitasking and an event loop to manage tasks. With `select()`, we’ll be writing our own version of an event loop, albeit more simply and synchronously. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section, we’ll look at examples of a server and client that address the problems outlined above. The programs use `select()` to handle multiple connections simultaneously and call `send()` and `recv()` as many times as needed."

    "\n",
    "In the next two sections, we’ll explain how the server and client handle multiple connections using a selector object created from the [selectors](https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html) module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multi-Connection Server\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s look at the multi-connection server, multiconn-server.py. Here’s the first part that sets up the listening socket:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import socket\n",
    "import selectors\n",
    "\n",
    "sel = selectors.DefaultSelector()\n",
    "\n",
    "host = '127.0.0.1'\n",
    "port = 12358     # I love fibonacii sequences\n",

    "lsock.setblocking(False)\n",
    "sel.register(lsock, selectors.EVENT_READ, data=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference between this server and the echo server is the call to `lsock.setblocking(False)` to configure the socket in non-blocking mode. Calls made to this socket will no longer block. Instead we block on the selector.  When it’s used with `sel.select()`, as you’ll see below, we can wait for events on *one or more sockets* and then read and write data when it’s ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Blocking Calls**\n",
    ">\n",
    "A socket function or method that temporarily suspends your application is a blocking call. For example, `accept(), connect(), send()`, and `recv()` “block.” They don’t return immediately. Blocking calls have to wait on system calls (I/O) to complete before they can return a value. So you, the caller, are blocked until they’re done or a timeout or other error occurs.\n",
    ">\n",
    "Blocking socket calls can be set to non-blocking mode so they return immediately. If you do this, you’ll need to at least refactor or redesign your application to handle the socket operation when it’s ready.\n",
    ">\n",
    "Since the call returns immediately, data may not be ready. The callee is waiting on the network and hasn’t had time to complete its work. If this is the case, the current status is the errno value socket.EWOULDBLOCK. Non-blocking mode is supported with setblocking().\n",
    ">\n",
    "By default, sockets are always created in blocking mode. See [Notes on socket timeouts](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html#notes-on-socket-timeouts) for a description of the three modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sel.register()` registers the socket to be monitored with sel.select() for the events you’re interested in. For the listening socket, we want to handle *read events* using `selectors.EVENT_READ`.  (The other events that can be monitored are EVENT_WRITE and timeout).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `data` parameter is used to store whatever arbitrary data you’d like along with the socket. It’s returned when `select()` returns. We’ll use data to keep track of what’s been sent and received on the socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next is the event loop:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`sel.select(timeout=None)` **blocks** until there are sockets ready for I/O. It returns a **list** of `(key, events)` tuples, **one for each socket** (That's why we have the `for` loop -- we want to handle multiple client sockets asynchronously).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* The `key` parameter is a [`SelectorKey`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/selectors.html#selectors.SelectorKey) namedtuple.  The items within the namedtuple are\n",

    "   \n",
    "* The `mask` parameter is an event mask (a bitmap) indicating the operations (EVENT_READ or EVENT_WRITE or both) that are ready. \n",
    "\n",
    "If key.data is None, then we know it’s from the listening socket and we need to `accept()` a new connection. We’ll call our own `accept()` wrapper function to get the new socket object and register it with the selector. We’ll look at the wrapper in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
