<h1>CS457 LAB 6</h1>
<p>Oh Look!!!  In this lab I wrote a perfectly wonderful web server that works to any web browser.  
<br /> I am learning so much in this class!  </p>

<p style="color:red;">
By the way, my name is <b><em> Casey Key </em></b>. </p>

<p>Here is a link to another file to be served up by my webserver.  I hope it works!!
<br \>
<a href="http://localhost:6789/HelloWorldLink.html">This is the link</a></p>

<p>Here is a link to another web site.  My web server does not serve up this page.  The remote site serves it.!!
