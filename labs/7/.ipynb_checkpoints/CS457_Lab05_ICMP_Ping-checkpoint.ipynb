    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will gain a better understanding of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). You will learn to implement a Ping application using ICMP request and reply messages.\n",
    "Ping is a computer network application used to test whether a particular host is reachable across an IP network. It is also used to self-test the network interface card of the computer or as a latency test. It works by sending ICMP “echo reply” packets to the target host and listening for ICMP “echo reply” replies. The \"echo reply\" is sometimes called a pong. Ping measures the round-trip time, records packet loss, and prints a statistical summary of the echo reply packets received (the minimum, maximum, and the mean of the round-trip times and in some versions the standard deviation of the mean).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to develop your own Ping application in Python. Your application will use ICMP but, in order to keep it simple, will not exactly follow the official specification in RFC 1739. Note that you will only need to write the client side of the program, as the functionality needed on the server side is built into almost all operating systems.\n",
    "You should complete the Ping application so that it sends ping requests to a specified host separated by approximately one second. Each message contains a payload of data that includes a timestamp. After sending each packet, the application waits up to one second to receive a reply. If one second goes by without a reply from the server, then the client assumes that either the ping packet or the pong packet was lost in the network (or that the server is down).\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab requires you to compose new python code.  A skeleton framework is given, you will need to fill in the blanks. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Additional Notes\n",
    "1. In “receiveOnePing” method, you need to receive the structure ICMP_ECHO_REPLY and fetch the information you need, such as checksum, sequence number, time to live (TTL), etc. Study the “sendOnePing” method before trying to complete the “receiveOnePing” method.\n",
    "2. You do not need to be concerned about the checksum, as it is already given in the code.\n",
    "3. When you extract the ICMP portion of the packet, don't forget to account for the length of the other headers(IP...) as you index into the received packet.\n",
    "4. This lab requires the use of **raw sockets**. In most operating systems, you may need administrator/root\n",
    "privileges to be able to run your Pinger program.  Therefore you will need to do a \"sudo\" command on your own laptop, or use the VM machines we have set up for you and do a \"sudo\" with the VM.  This also implies that you should save and edit the code on your machine (or the VM).  You cannot run the code directly from this jupyter lab because, as far as I know, you can't do a sudo with jupyter.\n",
    "5. You might want to check your output against a wireshark trace to make sure the TTL and other parameters that you print are correct.  This is optional, but recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing the Pinger\n",
    "First, test your client by sending packets to localhost, that is, 127.0.0.1.\n",
    "Then, you should see how your Pinger application communicates across the network by pinging servers in different continents."

    "1. Currently, the program calculates the round-trip time for each packet and prints it out individually. Modify this to correspond to the way the standard ping program works. You will need to report the minimum, maximum, and average RTTs at the end of all pings from the client. In addition, calculate the packet loss rate (in percentage).\n",

Modify the Pinger program to parse the ICMP response error codes and display the corresponding error results to the user.
