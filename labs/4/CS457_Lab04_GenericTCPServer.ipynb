    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab finalizes our set of TCP tutorials by implementing a generic asynchronous multi-connection application server that handles application data encoding/decoding as well as better error handling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this lab you will examine and execute an existing client/server application to understand how its underlying class structure works.  Then, after reading a lengthy but informative explanation, you will make a small modification to the python code to implement two simple new commands: \n",
    "\n",
    "* `double`: takes an integer and returns the integer value multiplied by two\n",
    "* `negate`: takes an integer and returns the negative value of that integer\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds simple?  Not unless you truly understand how data is formatted \"on the wire\"...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Yes, I know this lab is long and there is a lot to read\n",
    "\n",
    "But you need to understand the concepts introduced in this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acknowledgements and Citations\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is sourced with permission from the tutorial by Nathan Jennings [Socket Programming in Python](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/).  It has been edited for clarity and slightly modified and tuned for CS457.  The tutorial has also been modified to run within a Jupyter Notebook.  "

    "### Test Drive the Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the structure and inner workings of the application, you should first simply run it to see what it does.  In essence, the client creates a packet containing a command and associated parameter to the server.  The server executes the command and returns the results to the client.  The only built-in command is \"search\", which will return information for only a few items that have been hard-coded into the application.  Any other command besides \"search\" will put the server in binary mode and it will simply return the first 10 bytes of the command and parameters.  Here are the steps for you to run the program:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Execute the four code blocks in the cells below to save the files into your current working directory.\n",
    "2. Per the instructions below, create a terminal window, navigate to the working directory, and start the server.  The server takes two command line parameters, an IP address (e.g. '127.0.0.1' or '' for any IP) and a port number.\n",
    "3. Then, per the instructions below, create another terminal window, navigate to the working directory, and run several experiments by invoking the client program with different parameters.  The client takes four command line parameters: an IP address and port number, a command (e.g. search), and a command parameter indicating what to search for."

Obviously, our client or server shouldn’t come crashing down in a ball of fury if an exception isn’t caught. This is something we haven’t discussed up until now and has been intentionally left out for brevity and clarity in the examples.  We also want to show how to handle data formatting and data interpretation in our generic application server.\n",

    "#### Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you’re familiar with basic API, non-blocking sockets, and `select()`, we can add some error handling and discuss a custom class designed to handle data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let’s address the errors:\n",
    "\n",
    ">“All errors raise exceptions. The normal exceptions for invalid argument types and out-of-memory conditions can be raised; starting from Python 3.3, errors related to socket or address semantics raise OSError or one of its subclasses.” [(Source)](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to catch `OSError`. Another thing that hasn't been mentioned in relation to errors is timeouts. You’ll see them discussed in many places in the documentation. Timeouts happen and are a “normal” error. Hosts and routers are rebooted, switch ports go bad, cables go bad, cables get unplugged, you name it. You should be prepared for these and other errors and handle them in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling TCP data streams:  buffering\n",
    "\n",
    "As hinted by the socket type `socket.SOCK_STREAM`, when using TCP, you’re reading from a continuous stream of bytes. It’s like reading from a file on disk, but instead you’re reading bytes from the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike reading a file, there’s no `f.seek()`. In other words, you can’t reposition the socket pointer, if there was one, and move randomly around the data reading whatever, whenever you’d like.\n",
    "\n",
    "When bytes arrive at your socket, there are network buffers involved. Once you’ve read them, they need to be saved somewhere. Calling `recv()` again reads the next stream of bytes available from the socket.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that you’ll be reading from the socket in chunks. You need to call `recv()` and save the data in a buffer until you’ve read enough bytes to have a complete message that makes sense to your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s up to you to define and keep track of where the message boundaries are. As far as the TCP socket is concerned, it’s just sending and receiving raw bytes to and from the network. It knows nothing about what those raw bytes mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling TCP data streams:   data encoding/decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "This bring us to defining an application-layer protocol. What’s an application-layer protocol? Put simply, your application will send and receive messages. These messages are your application’s protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the length and format you choose for these messages define the semantics and behavior of your application. This is directly related to what was explained in the previous paragraph regarding reading bytes from the socket. When you’re reading bytes with `recv()`, you need to keep up with how many bytes were read and figure out where the message boundaries are.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this done? One way is to always send fixed-length messages. If they’re always the same size, then it’s easy. When you’ve read that number of bytes into a buffer, then you know you have one complete message.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, using fixed-length messages is inefficient for small messages where you’d need to use padding to fill them out. Also, you’re still left with the problem of what to do about data that doesn’t fit into one message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll take a generic approach. An approach that’s used by many protocols, including HTTP. We’ll prefix messages with a header that includes the content length as well as any other fields we need. By doing this, we’ll only need to keep up with the header. Once we’ve read the header, we can process it to determine the length of the message’s content and then read that number of bytes to consume it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll implement this by creating a **custom class** that can send and receive messages that contain text or binary data. You can improve and extend it for your own applications. The most important thing is that you’ll be able to see an example of how this is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The next issue is extremely important*. As we talked about earlier, when sending and receiving data via sockets, you’re sending and receiving raw bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you receive data and want to use it in a context where it’s interpreted as multiple bytes, for example a 4-byte integer, you **must**  take into account the differences in byte ordering between the host and the network.  The network will send the data in *network byte order*, a format that might be different than the byte order native to your machine’s CPU. Furthermore, the client or server on the other end of the network connection could have a CPU that uses a different byte order than your own.  We will give a better definition of \"*network byte-order*\" vs \"*host byte-order*\" and give examples on how to do byte-order conversion a little bit later."

It’s responsible for waking up when read and write events are ready to be processed on the socket. Which means, indirectly, it’s also responsible for calling the method `process_events()`. This is what I mean when I say the method `process_events()` is the entry point.\n",

This keeps the logic as simple as possible as events come in on the socket for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem obvious, but the first few iterations of the class were a mix of some methods that checked the current state and, depending on their value, called other methods to process data outside `read()` or `write()`. In the end, this proved too complex to manage and keep up with.\n",

    "Finally...  you get to do something besides read!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to add two commands, `double` and `negate`, to the application.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this you will use binary format for data interchange between the client and the server,rather than JSON format as used in the `search` command.  The reason for this is to teach you the method that many applications use to intercommunicate.  Binary format is much more efficient on the wire than sending JSON.  JSON, of course, is easier for humans to read.  Binary format is not.  That is why wireshark has so many plugins to interpret the application level interface (e.g. DNS interpretation).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you should implement; you can do this with about a twenty lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify app-client.py to check for the 2 new commands.  If so, pack a 10 byte variable using `struct.pack()` to contain the 6 byte string with the command name and a 4-byte integer in network order (hint: the format string should be \">6si\").  Set the JSON header to indicate binary data just like the default case.  The content should be your packed variable.\n",
    "2. Modify the libserver.py routine that processes binary data to check for the existence of either command. If so, unpack the 4 byte integer (don't forget byte order!  hint: format string \">i\").  Do the appropriate math on the value.  Then pack a new variable with a 6 byte string \"result\" followed by the 4 byte integer result.  Send it as binary data back to the client.  \n",
    "3. Modify libclient.py in the routine that checks for binary data.  If the byte array contains the word `result`, print the binary string then unpack the integer result and print a line containing \"result: xxx\" where xxx is your calculated return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some things to watch out for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `struct.unpack` returns a tuple.  You only want to print the first element of the tuple.\n",
    "* binary data is a python byte array, not a string.  You will have to convert the command string to a byte array using mystring.encode().  You will also have to do compare operations using something like b\"negate\" and b\"double\".\n"
